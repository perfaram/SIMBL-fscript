# SIMBL-fscript
##### SIMBL Plugin for loading FScript into unyielding applications. 
## Purpose 
Runtime exploration of Objective-C and Objective-C++ programs through F-Script's Object Browser and Console.
Specifically, this plugin comes in handy when the program you want to explore disables debugger-attaching (so you can't use it to load the F-Script framework), or when the program has no menu bar (such as a status-bar-only app). In these cases, use EasySIMBL to load this plugin, and then use the shortcuts to control F-Script ! (see below for detailed instructions).

## Installing
* Download EasySIMBL (https://github.com/norio-nomura/EasySIMBL/releases)
* Extract and move EasySIMBL.app into /Applications or ~/Applications
* Launch EasySIMBL.app and check Use SIMBL, then quit EasySIMBL.app
* Download FScript (https://github.com/Kentzo/F-Script/releases) and put it in /Library/Frameworks/
* Use *this* project ("download" button on the right)
* Compile it (xCode)
* Add it into EasySIMBL's Plugin Folder (usually, `~/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins/"
* Activate it in EasySIMBL
* Profit ! (see below for use)

## Way(s) to use
* Use the newly created `F-Script` item in the app's main menu (in the top menu bar).
* Shortcuts : *⌘ + ⌥ + ⇧ + C* to show console, *⌘ + ⌥ + ⇧ + O* to show Object browser.
* Use the UDP socket at port 7138 : `echo -n "bundleID.command" | nc -4u -w0 localhost 7138`. Replace `bundleID` by the target app's bundle ID (eg *com.panic.Coda2*), and `command` by *console* or *browser*.

NB : This will load FScript into all applications. To load it into one specific app, edit Info.plist's BundleIdentifier key (into SIMBLTargetApplications array) to match your app's identifier.
